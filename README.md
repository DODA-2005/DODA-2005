## Hi, I’m Pranav 👋

I work at the intersection of **robotics, computer vision, and embedded systems**, with a focus on building systems that connect **physical interaction** with **real-time software intelligence**.

My projects range from vision-controlled electromechanical systems to computer-vision–driven digital twins for physical modeling and visualization.

---

### What I work on
- 🤖 **Robotics & Embedded Systems**  
  Microcontrollers, motor control, sensor integration, custom PCBs

- 👁️ **Computer Vision**  
  Real-time tracking, geometric modeling, vision-based interaction systems

- 🧠 **AI & Intelligent Systems**  
  Practical ML, perception pipelines, system-level integration

- ⚙️ **Hardware–Software Co-design**  
  Designing systems where software constraints are driven by physical behavior

---

### Selected Projects
- **Vision-Controlled Robotic Hand**  
  Real-time hand-tracking–based control of a physical robotic hand using computer vision and embedded control.

- **Cantilever Beam Digital Twin (Computer Vision)**  
  A vision-driven, interaction-based digital twin for visualizing beam deflection and load behavior in real time.

- **High-Speed Line Follower Robot (LFR)**  
  Competition-grade line follower with custom PCB design, PID control, and high-speed tuning.

---

### How I build
- Python, C/C++, Embedded C  
- OpenCV, MediaPipe  
- Microcontrollers (Teensy, Arduino, ESP-class)  
- Custom PCBs, rapid prototyping, hardware testing

---

### Currently exploring
- Advanced control systems  
- Vision-based physical modeling  
- Robust embedded architectures for real-time systems
